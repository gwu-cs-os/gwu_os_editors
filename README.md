# Repository of Configuration Files and Documentation for Programming Environments

It is really important to become adept with the tools of your trade.
You will be much more effective if you use powerful tools, and you spend time learning to use them well.
This repo includes a subdirectory for a variety of programming tools, including `emacs`, `tmux`, and `vscode`.

Please do pull requests for additional tools.

If you want to use a tool, copy the dotfile(s) for it to your home directory (unless otherwise noted).
The `README.md` in each tool's directory should include an overview of the tool, an overview of how to use it (for beginners), and a set of links for people to learn more.

## Regarding VIM config
Just copy the file onto your home directory as .vimrc.
